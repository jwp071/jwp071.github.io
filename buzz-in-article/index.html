                <p class="lead">A virtual buzzer allowing you to play quiz based games with friends and family around
                    the world.</p>
                <img src="../img/Trivia Buzzer Feature Graphic.png"><br><br>
                <div class="text-left">
                    <p>On Easter, my extended family organized a trivia session on a Zoom video conference where there
                        was
                        one host and lots of teams trying to be the first to answer a question by typing it into the
                        group
                        chat. While this was a lot of fun. I thought to myself that it would be better if we had the
                        opportunity to buzz in instead of just frantically typing away. A buzzer approach would even the
                        playing field more by allowing the teams that were slower typers to still participate by only
                        needing to hit a single button. This approach would also allow for more social interaction
                        by allowing the first team that buzzed in to answer aloud.</p>
                    <p>So, soon after that game finished, I searched for buzzer applications that would meet this
                        goal and was surprised to see that there were not any (at least on Google Play). The only other
                        similar apps required users to be on the same WiFi network or same room using a Bluetooth
                        connection, but this solution does not work well for family video conferences where people are
                        in
                        different cities and states.</p>
                    <p>
                        Since I found an application that did not sound overly complicated to make that had the
                        potential to
                        bring a lot of joy to people, I set out to make the Buzz In! app. All in all, the app took me a
                        few
                        weeks to create
                        working on it off and on. You can now find it published on the Google Play Store <a
                            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cactusbiceps.triviabuzzer"
                            target="_blank">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cactusbiceps.triviabuzzer"
                        target="_blank">Buzz In!</a>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                    <p>The buzzer requires at least one host device and one player device in order to use. Only one
                        device should
                        be the
                        host at any point in the game in order to accurately keep track of which player was the first to
                        buzz
                        in.</p>

                    <p>The host device is able to view the timestamp and order of every player that buzzes in. The
                        host
                        is also
                        able to
                        clear the round to allow for new buzzes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each player device can buzz in and celebrate with confetti and exploding tacos whenever they
                        are
                        the first
                        to buzz
                        in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Buzz In! app requires an Internet connection for every device in the competition.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                    <p>
                        Open the app then enter a Group Name and a Player Name. The Group Name needs to match with
                        everyone else
                        playing, so
                        ensure everyone uses the same group (watch out for typos). The Player Name should be the name
                        you
                        would
                        like to use
                        when buzzing in. This name will be shown to the host when you buzz in so make it as creative as
                        you
                        like!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After entering the Group and Player Name fields, go to the Host or Player screen depending
                        on
                        which role you
                        want to
                        be. The host device will need to initiate the group and round by clicking on the "New Round"
                        button
                        before anyone
                        will be allowed to buzz in.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What about non-Android users?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently, the game host has to use the Android app, but I have created a web friendly version
                        that players can use to buzz-in if they do not have an Android device. If you are interested in
                        this arrangement, please contact me, and I will happily share the link with you.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What types of games can I play?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The app is a great addition to any type of game show, such as Jeopardy! or Family Feud. It also
                        works well in quiz bowl or general trivia type settings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have personally used it to play Jeopardy with friends by creating my own question board using
                        Flippity. Flippity allows you to create a trivia board that you can easily screen share with
                        friends using a video conference platform, such as Google Meet or Zoom. Check out Flippity here:
