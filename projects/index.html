<p class="projects-description">
    The Buzz In! buzzer app is the first virtual network buzzer on the app store to truly be a remote buzzer! Anyone
    across the world can join your group and compete to be the first one to buzz in. The Buzz In! app differs from other
    similar apps by not requiring users to be on the same WiFi connection. The app serves as a great tool for playing
    various game shows (think Family Feud or Jeopardy!) or quiz bowl type competitions.<br>

    <br><i>Do you need a fun way to determine which person buzzes in first in your video trivia game during
        quarantine?</i>

    <br><br>The idea for this application originated from playing trivia through a video conference with friends and
    family
    while everyone quarantined. We needed an unbiased and accurate way to tell which team buzzed in first to answer each
    question. This application meets that goal and adds a little bit of extra fun for everyone involved.

    <br><br><b>Technical Details</b>
    <br><br>The buzzer requires at least one host device and one player device in order to use. Only one device should
    be the
    host at any point in the game in order to accurately keep track of which player was the first to buzz in.

    <br><br>The host device is able to view the timestamp and order of every player that buzzes in. The host is also
    able to
    clear the round to allow for new buzzes.

    <br><br>Each player device can buzz in and celebrate with confetti and exploding tacos whenever they are the first
    to buzz
    in.

    <br><br>The Buzz In! app requires an Internet connection for every device in the competition.

    <br><br><b>Getting Started</b>
    <br><br>Open the app then enter a Group Name and a Player Name. The Group Name needs to match with everyone else
    playing, so
    ensure everyone uses the same group (watch out for typos). The Player Name should be the name you would like to use
    when buzzing in. This name will be shown to the host when you buzz in so make it as creative as you like!

    <br><br>After entering the Group and Player Name fields, go to the Host or Player screen depending on which role you
    want to
    be. The host device will need to initiate the group and round by clicking on the "New Round" button before anyone
    will be allowed to buzz in.
