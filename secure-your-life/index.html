                        Emails and text messages are two of the most popular forms of communication. The following
                        article will describe two software products that greatly secure these methods of communication
                        in a very user friendly fashion.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a target="_blank" href="https://protonmail.com/">Protonmail</a></h2>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-5">
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://protonmail.com/"><img class="img-fluid"
                                    src="../img/security/protomail.jpeg"></a>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://protonmail.com/">Protonmail</a> is an email service that has a
                        lot of the same
                        look and feel that Gmail offers. The
                        major difference between Protonmail and Gmail is that Protonmail has much higher levels of
                        privacy than Gmail does.
                    </p>
                    <p>Protonmail stores every email on their servers in an encrypted format that allows no one other
                        than you to read your emails. In addition to that, Protonmail has greatly simplified the process
                        of exchanging encrypted emails with another individual. For anyone that has used PGP email
                        encryption, you probably know that setting that up is beyond the capabilities of the typical
                        user.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Protonmail Benefits:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            End to End Encryption between Protonmail users (or any advanced PGP users on another email
                            platform)
                        </li>
                        <li>Encrypted Email Storage</li>
                        <li>Send Encrypted emails to any email</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Gmail Benefits: </h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Great shareable calendar integration</li>
                        <li>Lots of storage for free</li>
                        <li>Filters emails into categories automatically</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        What exactly does end to end encryption mean? This means that no one other than the sender and
                        the recipient can read your email. Why this is not the standard for every email platform is
                        beyond me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Encrypted email storage gives you the piece of mind that your emails cannot be read by anyone
                        associated with the administration of the email servers or any third party software development
                        teams that are given access without your knowledge or consent (perhaps, you could argue that
                        they have your consent since you agreed to the lengthy terms and conditions to use the service).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the neatest features of Protonmail is the ability to send encrypted emails that are
                        password protected to any email of your choice. This allows you to send potentially confidential
                        information to someone that does not have a secure method in place to receive the information.
                        For example, your insurance agent requests personal identifiable information from you to setup
                        your account over an unencrypted email service. Let’s assume that the email service is at least
                        configured to use TLS (HTTPS vs HTTP) encryption to send the email across the network to prevent
                        packet sniffers from reading your data as it is sent. When your email with your personal
                        identifiable information is received by the insurance agent, you have no way of knowing who has
                        access to that agent’s emails or what they do with the email.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Now on to <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>...</h2>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-5">
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.signal.org/"><img class="img-fluid"
                                    src="../img/security/signal.jpeg"></a>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a> is a messaging app that works with
                        Android and iOS
                        devices to securely send your messages
                        to the appropriate party by utilizing an end to end encryption technique to keep prying eyes
                        from reading your messages. Again, why encrypted communication is not the standard form of
                        communication for everyone is a little baffling to me. Whether you have something to hide or
                        not, why would you want to send messages to someone that anyone could intercept and read when
                        you have the option to send all messages securely?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also like Protonmail, the great thing about Signal is that their team has made the whole
                        encryption process so easy that the average user would not even be able to tell that the
                        application is any different from a standard SMS platform. In addition to ease of use, the
                        mobile application has a great interface and incorporates all of the fun things like an
                        expansive emoji set and GIFs galore. So many security applications have stripped all of the fun
                        features out of them to the point where no one wants to use them for everyday communication.
                        Signal also has a desktop messaging application that you can use in addition to the mobile
                        application although the desktop application in my experience has been a bit clunky and not as
                        feature rich.
                    </p>
